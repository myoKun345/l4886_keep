"The modern equivalent of Mary Queen of Scots might well be the unsuccessful businesswoman who owes her position to her family , and therefore profoundly irritates women who are achieving success --- against the natural order of things . Second , the problem of female rule was arguably less severe in Scotland than elsewhere . Scotland was still , by contemporary standards , an unusually localized country , in which the government impinged less ; and it had two centuries of experience of long periods of royal minorities in which government and political life had to be <kept going without the> guiding hand of a monarch . For precisely these reasons , there was a well-developed sub-stratum of social and political control at local level in the kingdom at large ; and when people are accustomed to running affairs without any monarch at all , then the advent of a female ruler might well not be a substantial cause for concern . Lurking behind all this in Mary 's case is , of course , the notion of the gentler sex , with all that entails ; if nice men made bad kings , because successful kingship meant toughness and ruthlessness , how could the more emotional , gentler female hope to make a good queen ?",PASSIVE,PASSIVE,B
